Displays your coherent liabilities .. everybody has them .. everybody gets fucked by them once in a while .. stay on top!

<h3>Problem:</h3>
If you are .. well .. a person .. then you have things like an addresses, a telephone number or insurances.

Every once in a while you change some of these things and you almost always forget some of the things that depend on the thing you just changed.

For example: Maybe your cellphone provider needs to know your email address and your bank account. Now you change your bank and there will be a very good chance you forgot to change the account information at your cellphone provider. The result will be a dunning letter. That was the easy case. If you ever moved to a new city you know what kind of trouble this can be.
